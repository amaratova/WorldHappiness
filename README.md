# WorldHappiness
In this project I analyzed World Happiness in 2015-2019.

To analyse the happiness rank of 155 countries I used ready dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/notebooks 

The following data was used for analysis: economy (GDP per capita), social support, health (life expectancy), generosity, trust (government corruption), freedom, and dystopia residual.
