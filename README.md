# WorldHappiness
In this project I analyzed World Happiness in 2015-2019.

To analyse the happiness rank of 155 countries I used ready dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/notebooks 

The following data was used for analysis: happiness rank, happiness score, economy (GDP per capita), social support, health (life expectancy), generosity, trust (government corruption), freedom, and dystopia residual.

Additional data will be added with web scraping in futher steps.
